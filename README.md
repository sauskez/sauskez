<h2> 🧠 UFH – A Smarter Feed for the Terminally Online </h2>
<p>UFH is a long-running, ever-evolving project rooted in curiosity, technical exploration, and cutting through the noise.</p>
<b>Right now, I’m deep-diving into:</b>
🎮 Game Dev • 🧑‍💻 Programming • 🤖 ML/AI (minus the slop) • 🔒 Scam & threat actor avoidance
<p>I read a lot so you don’t have to—then share excerpts worth your time.</p>
<p>Expect tools, tutorials, updates on evolving internet culture, and strategies to help you stay sharp, informed, and ahead.</p>
<p>📡 Curated, not cluttered updates posted straight to Discord.</p>
<p>📚 Bonus blog posts & a podcast revival are coming too—when the timing’s right.</p>
<p>If you’re online too much, might as well make it worth it.</p>
